# Logarithmic-Transformation
Apply Logarithmic Transformation for correcting the contrast and sharpness of images without using any pre-built functions from any image editing libraries in python. Following Libraries are required :
  1. OpenCV (just for loading and writing images to your system)
  2. Numpy
  3. Math
  
Some images and their results have been provided as reference.
