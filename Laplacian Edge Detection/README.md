# Laplacian-Edge-Detection
Implementation of various Laplacians operator for edge detection in images without using any pre-built functions from any image editing libraries in python. Following Libraries are required :
  1. OpenCV (just for loading and writing images to your system)
  2. Numpy
  3. Math
  
An image with its result has been provided as reference.

Sample Image :
